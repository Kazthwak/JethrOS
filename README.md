# JethrOS

This is a garbage OS made by me. 
I'm currently working on keyboard and graphics drivers.
Check the todo list for more info but I am starting with keyboard, screen and disk driver and then I might move to wifi drivers, MAYBE. 
The important thing is that I COMMENT MY CODE.
Also, I know there is probably a way to compile the c file together, but using a python script to stitch them together is easier.

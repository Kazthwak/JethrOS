# JethrOS

This is a garbage OS made by me. 
I have interrupt (singular) working. YAAAAAAAAAAW :-). I cannot explain my joy with words.
The os-image is a binary file that if written to the start of a disk, *should* work properly.
The makefile generates an os-image and then runs it using qemu.
I fixed the makefile. It is mostly normal now.

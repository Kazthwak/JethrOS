is just file at specific location

all addresses are sector num (indexed from 1) in 64 bit (unsigned) int (supports over a pettabyte of disk storage)

sector 1 of file:

parent1\0
parent2\0
parent3\0\0
children (the address of their header)
child1\0
child2\0\0

length of file fragment (not including header) (32 bit unsigned int) (supports 4TB files)
--padded to correct num of sectors

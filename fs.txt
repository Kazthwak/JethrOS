root node
is just file at specific location

all addresses are sector num (indexed from 1) in 64 bit (unsigned) int (supports over a pettabyte of disk storage)

sector 1 of file:
byte of 3 bools; whether there is a header above it and wheather there is one below. Then wheather there is a virtual header file (VHF) (THEN 5 0s)
(only if not top header) address of top header
byte (fs version)
--only on top header-- IF THERE IS NO VHF
name\0
byte os specific code for user index (i.e. the user num, 0 = kernel file)
THIS MUST EXIST BUT CAN BE EMPTY IF THE OS DOESNT CARE
each address of children and parents follows this format:
64 bits: address
n bytes: name (n can be 0)
1 byte \0
SECOND \0 IF IT IS THE LAST ENTRY

Parent*s* (the address of their header)
parent1
parent2
parent3
\0
children (the address of their header)
child1
child2
\0
(only if there is a next header) address of next file fragment (64 bit unsigned int)
length of file fragment (not including header) (32 bit unsigned int) (supports 4TB file fragments)
--padded end of sector
if there is a VFH, it takes the form of a bin file (but it's contents replaces the rest of the header file of the og file. )

exapmle
Byte: 000, 00000
